# This script was made to solve two use cases:
#   - My locally-running DNS server on old-laptop would sometimes not bind to the bridge interface that my KVM guests live on due to differences in execution order.
#   - Making sure that my DNS is set up correctly before connecting to the home VPN so that I can resolve home addresses while still being able to resolve any addresses specific to my location.
