# Scripts Directory

Scripts are stored in this directory.
To try and make things a little organized, they are sorted into sub-directories by topic.

If you wish to use one of these scripts directly, I would recommend one of the following:

* Make an alias for the script.
* Add a symbolic link to the script in bin/
