# Scripts Directory

Scripts are stored in this directory.

There may be a bit of redundancy in functions as the scripts were (mostly) made to be able to copied out of a checkout and used independently.

To try and make things a little organized, they are sorted into sub-directories by topic.

If you wish to use one of these scripts directly, I would recommend one of the following:

* Make an alias for the script in `bash/functions/`.
* Add a symbolic link to the script in bin/
