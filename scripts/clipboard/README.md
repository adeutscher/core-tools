## Script Clipboard

This directory is intended for storing common function snippets for use in other scripts.

The goal is to avoid having to wonder "oh, which script also used those functions again?" when constructing a new script.

**Reminder**: These files should to be pasted in, not sourced in or otherwise loaded in whatever method their language uses. This is that so (most) individual scripts can be simply yoinked out of this tools repository without needing any adaptation. The downside of this is that it does make maintaining these common functions more difficult as more scripts that use them are added, but I am willing to accept the trade-off.
