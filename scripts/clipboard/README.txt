This directory is intended for storing common function snippets for use in other scripts.

The goal is to avoid having to wonder "oh, which script also used those functions again?".

NOTE: These files are to be pasted in, not sourced in. This is that so (most) individual scripts can be simply yoinked out of the environment as needed without any tweaking.
