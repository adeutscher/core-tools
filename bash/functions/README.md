# BASH Functions

This directory attempts to sort BASH functions by topic.
Any file ending in `.sh` will be loaded in.

*Most* numberings are arbitrary. The numbering system was mostly put in place to make sure that structural functions were put in place before they were used when loading tools.

The following files should definitely be loaded very early on:

* `00-clean.sh`: Axes some functions and aliases to avoid errors in long-running sessions.
* `03-tools.sh`: Structual functions
