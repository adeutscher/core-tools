# Reminders

This directory has a bunch of lazy reminders for how to do some stuff that I might need reminding about but haven't converted into a script, function, or alias.

All of this stuff should be documented on my home wiki in one place or another, these notes are a useful fallback when VPN isn't an option.
Alternately, the documents may summarize items out of a `man` page that I find to be the most useful.
