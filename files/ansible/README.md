# Ansible Playbooks

Various Ansible playbooks for setting up items on Linux boxes.

Useful for basic setups or as examples for more formal Ansible roles.

Like with my scripts, there will probably be some redundancy between general workstation playbooks and the more specialized playbooks (e.g. repositories). While inconvenient, this makes it easier to take a single playbook file and use it independently of the core-tools repo.
